# FlareNetworks_Java_Contract_Wrappers

Java bindings for Flare Networks' smart contracts for Flare and Songbird

These wrappers are generated by web3j CLI from using the JSON artifacts produced by the hardhat build in https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts/

They are provided as-is with no warranty and with the sole purpose of making the lives of anyone who is using web3j/java on Android or another platform a little easier.
